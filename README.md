## Learning Objectives
* Solidify basic HTML and CSS knowledge
* Practice git commands in the CLI
* Refactoring code-- the goal is to always leave code "prettier" than you found it :)
* Practice creating usable and informative README files

## Acceptance Criteria
User was given starter code and prompted with the following Acceptance Criteria

```
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## Review
Throughout this project I ran into several problems that needed to be fixed in order to meet the guidelines laid out for me. This caused me to do my own research and figure out how to solve different issues. My updated HTML and CSS files are now more correctly formatted and each element works as intended.
